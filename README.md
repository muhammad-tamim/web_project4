## Project Name: Bangladesh 2.0
## Project Description:
This is a simple web development project created using HTML and CSS, with a focus on learning and applying Flexbox. The primary objective of this project was to implement the fundamental concepts and techniques I have studied over the past few weeks.

## Note:
The website is not responsive. My display resolution is 1600 x 900 pixels, so I designed this webpage based on my screen. For the best viewing experience, please resize your browser window to match this resolution.

## What I newly learned while building this project:
1. When I wanted to create Your Opinion Matters, I faced some issues while designing the table. So, I should focus on learning more about tables.
2. I still feel uncomfortable using CSS positions, so I should focus on learning more about positions.

Thank you for checking out my project! I am continuously learning and improving myself, so your feedback and suggestions would mean a lot to me.
